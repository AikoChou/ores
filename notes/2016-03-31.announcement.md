Hey folks, we have a couple of announcements for you today.  First is that ORES has a large set of new functionality that you might like to take advantage of.  We'll also want to talk about a breaking change that's coming in a week. 

# New functionality

## Scoring UI
Sometimes you just want to score a few revisions in ORES and remembering the URL structure is hard.  So, we've build a simple [scoring user-interface](https://ores.wmflabs.org/ui/) that will allow you to more easily score a set of edits.

## New API version
We've been consistently getting requests to include more information in ORES' responses.  In order to make space for this new information, we needed to change the structure of responses.  But we wanted to do this without breaking the tools that are already using ORES.  So, we've developed a versioning scheme that will allow you to take advantage of new functionality when you are ready.  The same old API will continue to be available at https://ores.wmflabs.org/scores/, but we've added two additional paths on top of this. 

* https://ores.wmflabs.org/v1/scores/ is a mirror of the old scoring API which will henceforth be referred to as "v1"
* https://ores.wmflabs.org/v2/scores/ implements a new response format that is consistent between all sub-paths and adds some new functionality

## Swagger documentation
Curious about the new functionality available in "v2" or maybe what the change was from "v1"?  We've implemented a structured description of both versions of the scoring API using swagger -- which is becoming a defacto stanard for this sort of thing.  Visit https://ores.wmflabs.org/v1/ or https://ores.wmflabs.org/v2/ to see the Swagger user-interface.  Visit https://ores.wmflabs.org/v1/spec/ or https://ores.wmflabs.org/v2/spec/ to get the specification in a machine-readable format.

## Feature values & injection
Have you wondered what ORES uses to make it's predictions?  You can now ask ORES to show you the list of "feature" statistics it uses to score revisions.  For example, https://ores.wmflabs.org/v2/scores/enwiki/wp10/34567892/?features will return the score with a mapping of feature values used by the "wp10" article quality model in English Wikipedia to score [34567892](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/34567892).  You can also "inject" features into the scoring process to see how that affects the prediction.  E.g., https://ores.wmflabs.org/v2/scores/enwiki/wp10/34567892?features&feature.wikitext.revision.chars=10000  See [our writeup](#) using this functionality to demonstrate the strong bias against anons that ORES' damage detection models have learned. 

# Breaking change -- new models
We've been experimenting with new learning algorithms to make ORES work better and we've found that we get better results with [gradient boosting](#) and [random forest](#) strategies than we do with the current [linear svc](#) models.  We'd like to get these new, better models deployed as soon as possible, but with the new algorithm comes a change in the *range* of probabilities returned by the model.  So, when we deploy this change, any tools that uses hard-coded thresholds on ORES' prediction probabilities will suddenly start behaving strangely.  Regretfully, we haven't found a way around this problem, so we're announcing the change now and we plan to deploy on ####.  

In order to make sure we don't end up in the same situation the next time we want to change an algorithm, we've included a suite of evaluation statistics with each model.  The filter_rate_at_recall(0.9), filter_rate_at_recall(0.75), and recall_at_fpr(0.1) thresholds represent three critical thresholds that can be used to automatically configure your wiki tool.  So, come breaking change, we strongly recommend basing your thresholds on these statistics in the future.
